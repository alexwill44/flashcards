They are single calues or objects containing a set of values that are passed to React components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. i.e, They are data padded dopwn from a parent component to a child component \r\n The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following compoent functionality: \r\n\t 1. Pass custom data to your React component. \r\n\t 2. Trigger state changes. \r\n\t 3. Use viia this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method. \r\n\t For example, let us create an element with reactProp property,  \r\n\t <Element reactProp = \"1\" /> \r\n\t The reactProp (or whatever you name it) then becomes a property attached to React's native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library. \r\n\t props.reactProp;"
